Documentation
=============

Passpie documentation is always open to improvements, to help passpie with better documentation. Passpie documentation is hosted on https://readthedocs.org and documentation files are written in `RestructuredText for Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/contents.html>`_

Coding
======

::

    git clone https://github.com/marcwebbie/passpie.git
    cd passpie
    virtualenv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    make develop
    make


Importers
=========

Importers should be independent pluggable code. To add a new importer. Create python module into importers package. If you were writting an importer to a site called ``superpassword``.

::

    touch passpie/importers/superpassword.py

This importer should inherit from ``passpie.importers.BaseImporter`` and override two methods:

+ ``match``: This method should check file passed as filepath and see if it is parseable and can be read by importer

+ ``handle``: Return parsed credentials from file. The return must be a list of credentials with plain text passwords


.. code-block:: python

    from passpie.importers import BaseImporter


    class DefaultImporter(BaseImporter):

        def match(self, filepath):
            return True

        def handle(self, filepath):
            credentials = []
            return credentials
